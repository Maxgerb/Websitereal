<h3> The man behind the legend </h3>
    <p>
        I'm Max Gerbrands and I'm a 22 year old novice software engineer. I've enrolled into Software
        Engineering course at the NHL in Leeuwarden, after I discovered my passion for the soft(ware)
        part of life. At the rare occasion that I'm not procrastinating, I also enjoy reading comics,
        playing video games,watching movies and totally NOT having my ass kicked at martial arts.
    </p>
    <h3>Current focus</h3>
    <p>
        As of now, I'm still pursuing the arcane mastery over various programming languages. While the
        long-term goal of world domination is still beyond my reach, I'm interested in applying my knowledge
        in projects such as: a race-game and software that gives you control over certain electronics.
    </p>
    <h3> Me, myself and the future </h3>
    <p>
        When I've finished my software Engineering course, I'll be pursuing my interests within different fields of science,
        games and security.
